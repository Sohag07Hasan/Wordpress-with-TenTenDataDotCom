**************** Wordpress with TenTenData.Com ********************


How to use:
	1. Install the plugin
	2. Try to create a post. You will get a custom tag name (1010 Groups). You need to use the
		group ids from the 1010data.com
	3. Once a post/page/media is attached to any of the groups, it is considered as secured post/page.
	4. When a user/visior visits first time, they are shown a form to insert their credentails and if they submit
		the form, it is authenticated via 101data.com and shows the content or a forbidden message. 
	5. The form is very basic now. We can add popup/modal to make it attractive. I will do 
		having suggested from you.
